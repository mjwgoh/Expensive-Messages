# Expensive Messages
 
Created as a humorous joke (and social experiment), Expensive Messages is a high-value messaging platform allowing users to send $1000 messages to each other during Valentines Day. All messages sent will include the price tag of the message, as well as a URL to validate the price tag of the message. If a promo code was used to get a discount on the message, it would also be reflected accordingly.

Unfortunately, Mashable never called.
